# Swerve LimeSurvey template / theme

## What is it?
This modifies the Default [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/) layout a bit.

### What's different from the Default theme?
The questions with rankings have a new layout: your selections at the top, with the choices below, in columns.

## Installation
One could use the LimeSurvey interface or put the files into place.

### Requirements
It was written and tested on LimeSurvey 2.73.

### Config file changes
This template has custom views, so the config file requires an additional setting: `allow_templates_to_overwrite_views` in `application/config/config.php`, within the `config` array.

For more info, see [this section on the LimeSurvey Theme editor page.](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Theme_editor#Custom_Question_Views_.28version_2.5.29)

### LimeSurvey interface
